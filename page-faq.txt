<h1>Documentation & support</h1>

<b>What is the best way to get support ?</b>
<br />
The best way to get support is to use the users mailing list.
<br /><br />

<b>How can I learn more about Ray ?</b>
<br />
Ray is documented in Documentation/ directory of the distribution.
You can also check the Publications page.
<br /><br />

<b>How can I get help regarding my Ray usage ?</b>
<br />
You can send an email on
the mailing list.
<br /><br />

<h1>Installation</h1>

<b>What are the dependencies of Ray ?</b>
<br />
A C++ compiler that supports at least C++ 1998 (like GNU g++) and a MPI library that supports at least
MPI 1.0 (like Open-MPI or MPICH2).
<br /><br />



<h1>Running jobs</h1>

<b>Can I run Ray on many machines with MPI ?</b>
<br />
Yes.
<br /><br />

<b>Can I run Ray on a single processor core ?</b>
<br />

Yes. The single Ray process will send messages to itself.
<br />
<br />


<b>Can I assemble metagenomes with Ray ?</b>
<br />
Yes. Ray can do de novo metagenome assemblies (Ray Meta), and taxonomic
profiling too based on k-mer coloring (Ray Communities), among other things.
<br /><br />

<b>What types of analyses are possible with Ray ?</b>
<br />
These are supported and tested:
<i>de novo</i> assembly of single genomes and
<i>de novo</i> assembly of metagenomes.
Transcriptome <i>de novo</i> assembly is also
possible although this is not tested.
<br />
<br />


<b>What is latency and how do I read RayOutput/NetworkTest.txt</b>
<br />

The latency, measured in microseconds, is the time required to receive
a response to a message sent onto the network.
<br />
<br />


<b>Can I export my assembly in the AMOS format ?</b>
<br />
Yes. You can export your assembly in this format with the -amos option.

<br />
<br />

<b>Can I save the progress of my Ray jobs and resume them ?</b>
<br />
Yes, it can be done witht the option -read-write-checkpoints CheckpointDirectory.
<br />
<br />

<b>What is the maximum number processor cores that I can use (mpiexec -n N) ?</b>
<br />
100000 cores. 
<br /><br />

<h1>Running large jobs</h1>
<b>Is there special options for running large jobs ?</b>
<br />
Message routing can be enabled for large jobs to lower the latency in some cases.
See Documentation/ to learn more.
<br /><br />

<h1>Cloud</h1>

<b>Can I run Ray in the cloud, like on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) ?</b>
<br />
Yes, this is possible and tested.
The best way is to create your cluster with MIT
StarCluster and then to launch Ray. This 
<a href="http://omicsomics.blogspot.ca/2012/06/out-damned-spot-instance-out-i-say.html">
blog post</a>
is about that.

<br />
<br />

<h1>Data</h1>

<b>Where can I get public sequence data to test Ray ?</b>
<br />
The European Read Archive is a good start.
<br /><br />


<b>Can I use paired reads with Ray ?</b>
<br />
Yes. Paired reads are supported using -p file1.fastq file2.fastq.
<br />
<br />

<b>Can I use jumping libraries or fosmid libraries with Ray ?</b>
<br />

Yes, you can do that. Strands must be like <----- -----> or 
-----> <-----.
<br />
